     Water is made up of billions of molecules. ... <br>
      Water on our planet flows as liquid in rivers, streams, and oceans; <br>
       is solid as ice at the North and South Poles; and is gas (vapor) in the atmosphere. <br>
     Water is also underground and inside plants and animals.</h3></p> <br>
