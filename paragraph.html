<h1>Cars</h1>
<p>Cars is a 2006 American computer-animated road-comedy film
 produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney
  Pictures. Directed and co-written by John Lasseter 
  from a screenplay by Dan Fogelman, it was Pixar's 
  final independently-produced film before its purchase by Disney
   in May 2006. Set in a world populated entirely by
    anthropomorphic talking cars and other vehicles,
     the film stars the voices of Owen Wilson, 
     Paul Newman (in his final acting role), Bonnie Hunt,
      Larry the Cable Guy, Tony Shalhoub, Cheech Marin
      , Michael Wallis, George Carlin, Paul Dooley, Jenifer Lewis,
       Guido Quaroni, Michael Keaton, Katherine Helmond, 
       John Ratzenberger and Richard Petty.
        Race car drivers Dale Earnhardt Jr., Mario Andretti,
         Michael Schumacher and car enthusiast Jay Leno (as 
         "Jay Limo") voice themselves.

    Cars premiered on May 26, 2006 at Lowe's Motor Speedway
     in Concord, North Carolina and was theatrically released in
      the United States on June 9, 2006 to critical 
  and commercial success, grossing $462.2 million
 worldwide against a budget of $120 million.
  It was nominated for two Academy Awards including Best
     Animated Feature, but lost to Happy Feet. 
     but won both the Annie Award for Best Animated 
      Feature and the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated 
    Feature Film. The film was released on DVD on November 
    7, 2006 and on Blu-ray in 2007. The film was accompanied
    by the short One Man Band for its theatrical and home media releases.
    Merchandise based on the film (including scale models of
 several of the cars) broke records for retail sales of merchandise
based on a Disney/Pixar film,[2] bringing an estimated $10 billion for
              5 years after the film's release.[3] The film was dedicated to Joe Ranft,
               the film's co-director and co-writer,
                who died in a car accident during the film's production</p>
